### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser

open index.html

# Or just double-click the index.html file
```

### Option 2: Use a Local Server (Recommended)
For the best experience, use a local server:

**Using Python:**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Using Node.js (if you have it installed):**
```bash
npx serve
```

**Using PHP:**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css      # All styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # Scroll animations and interactivity

## Scroll Animation Features

1. **Intersection Observer**: Detects when elements enter the viewport
2. **Staggered Animations**: Cards appear one after another with delays
3. **Direction-based Slides**: Elements slide from different directions
4. **3D Rotations**: Sneakers rotate based on scroll position
5. **Parallax Effect**: Sneakers move at different speeds while scrolling
